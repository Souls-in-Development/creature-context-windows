//! Deterministic socket unification — the reconciler of specification 6.4.
//!
//! A `provides` socket is a shape an entity exposes; a `requires` socket is a
//! shape an entity needs. Extraction (the parser) proposes these shapes but
//! never decides whether two fit — "that division is what makes the mechanism
//! both cheap and trustworthy" (spec 6.4). This function is the deciding half:
//! it is the operation a linker performs, set intersection over shapes decided
//! arithmetically, and it writes a resolution onto every `requires` socket:
//!
//! - exactly one provider of the required name → a `fit` on the `inferred`
//!   plane with `status:unconfirmed`. Alignment is automatic only when it is
//!   unambiguous, and even then it is a claim about a connection, not a proven
//!   one — a compile or a test settles it later (spec 6.4).
//! - several providers → a `hole` with reason `ambiguous`, listing the
//!   candidates. Choosing among them is forbidden: a wrong connection is more
//!   expensive than an absent one, because a hole is visible and a miswiring is
//!   not.
//! - no provider → a `hole` with reason `no_match`, naming the absent shape.
//!
//! Matching is by the shape's name, never its signature alone: "signature alone
//! collides, and two functions with identical signatures are routinely not
//! interchangeable" (spec 6.4). The qualified name is part of the shape, and it
//! is the cheapest defence against wiring an internal identifier where an
//! external one belongs.
