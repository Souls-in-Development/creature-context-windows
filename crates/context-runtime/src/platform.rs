//! Platform capability matrix (specification 16, 18.4).
//!
//! Every native capability reports its true state, and this is where they are
//! gathered for the platform this build runs on. The rule the whole milestone
//! turns on: a capability that has not run on a platform reports `Unavailable`
//! or `ImplementedUnverified`, never a fabricated `Verified`. Native feature
//! status is reported only after actually running on the claimed platform.
//!
//! The matrix is per-current-platform by construction — it runs on one OS and
//! reports that OS's real state. The portable core beneath it (scan, Atlas,
//! Green, Orbit) is platform-neutral and produces equivalent records everywhere;
//! the adapters here are the I/O skin that differs.
