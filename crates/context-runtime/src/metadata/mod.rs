//! Native metadata projection (specification 16).
//!
//! Green state is projected onto the filesystem as native metadata — Finder tags
//! on macOS, and the equivalent per-OS surface elsewhere — so a person browsing
//! files sees the same colours the Atlas holds. The projection is *derived*: it
//! is a view of the Atlas, never a source of truth. Deleting it loses nothing,
//! because it is rebuilt from the Atlas on demand (spec §11, §16).
//!
//! This module owns the portable half — deciding which tag each entity gets from
//! its Green code. The per-OS submodules own the I/O skin that writes those tags,
//! and each reports its true capability state: an OS whose adapter has not been
//! implemented and run says `Unavailable`, never fabricates success (spec §16).
