//! The resident service behind `creature-context run`.
//!
//! One continuous loop: drain the watcher, journal each event *before* it is
//! processed, debounce, reconcile, then mark events applied *after* the
//! snapshot commits. The ordering is deliberate — an event journalled before
//! processing survives a crash mid-reconciliation, and a marker written only
//! after the commit means a restart never treats unfinished work as done.
//!
//! Applied markers use the journal's own append-only `.applied` sidecar
//! (`mark_applied`/`applied_ids`), not marker events mixed into the event
//! stream. The stream stays a pure record of what was observed.
