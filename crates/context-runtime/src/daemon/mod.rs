//! Registering the resident service with the operating system (specification 7.1, 16).
//!
//! `creature-context run` is the constant background lane, but a process started
//! from a terminal lives and dies with that terminal — so the Atlas was only
//! current while somebody kept a shell open, and the lane belonged to whoever
//! started it. This module hands the process to the OS's own supervisor instead,
//! so the daemon is resident across logins and belongs to no particular agent,
//! editor or session.
//!
//! The portable half lives here: deriving a stable per-project label and the
//! supervisor definition. The per-OS submodules own the I/O skin that registers
//! it, and each reports its true capability state — an OS whose adapter has not
//! been implemented and run says so rather than fabricating success (spec §16).
//!
//! Definitions are generated as data (`ServiceDefinition`) *before* anything is
//! written, so the exact file contents can be asserted in a test and validated by
//! the platform's own tooling without installing anything.
